I am interested interested in the intersection of Data Science and Cloud. Data is grower ever larger. Work that has been historically expensive and resource intensive (left to big organizations) can now be done with the agility of small teams or individuals.  

I am a Senior Data Engineer with a passion for Data Analysis and Visualization with Python, Machine Learning, Big Data and AWS Cloud.

I have 9 years of experience in leading data-driven software development in financial services building trading systems in the hedge fund industry. 

Certified Amazon AWS DevOps Engineer Professional and Solutions Architect Professional.
